**Golden Truly Hotel & casino**

Hi there! Welcome to [my first milestone project!](https://anthonycaf.github.io/Milestone1/)
My name is Anthony Chin A Foeng.
my project will be a upgrade from a existing website from my previous employer'
The golden truly hotel & Casino. [previous webpage](http://www.thegoldentrulyhotel.sr/index.html) 
In consulation with the hotelmanager Andrew Holmes of The Golden Truly hotel & casino, I decided to renew their website. First as a milestone project and maybe in the futere for their use of it.

My project contains a website about a hotel and it’s accomodation.
With this website I will give more inside about the hotel, the rooms and other facilities
On the contact page there can be made a reservation.

now I waiting for there approval for the font of the website, it they want to use this.


## 
**sales pitch**

Here by I provide a good working website that forfill your needs if you need a hotel in surinam.  
It is located in the main capital and close by the city center.  
On this site, you will find all the information needed about this hotel and their entertainment.  
And with a good website you will get people that are commited to a good looking hotel, and there services.  

## 
**UX**

With this website I want to promote the hotel and its business and there other accomodation.  
The best way to do this was by making a beter overview and layouts. Placing more pictures.  
Creating a comfortable homepage what is warm welcome for the reader. The ease of making a reservation on the website makes is more atractive for guest to make a reservation.  
By seeing what the hotel has more to offer in there accomodation, seeing the inside of the hotel, restaurant, casino and pool makes it more interesting to see it.   
Knowing more about there services is a good promotion for the business.  
And making the website mobile first approach, so that people can look it up on there phone, that is what attracts people to keep looking at the website.

**Bugs or problems during testing.**

Navbar wasn’t responsive, colums were to broad. It didn’t move when I resized the page
 Texst layout wasn’t aligned, so the text didn’t stay where it should be.
Header photo, was moving up and down as I scrolled. Didn’t stay on top.
